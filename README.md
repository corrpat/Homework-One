## Overview and Origin:

Betterment is an online investment company that offers investing and retirement solutions for its clients. This type of investment firm is commonly referred to as Robo-advisors, of which Betterment is considered one of the earliest examples. Betterment was founded in 2008 by Jon Stein, who started building the platform with his roomamte Sean Owen, a Google software engineer. Upon dealing with the regulatory landscape of building a broker-dealer, Stein brought in Eli Broverman as a co-founder. Broverman was a securities lawyer Stein had met over a regular poker game. [^1]

In the early days, Stein and Broverman raised $320,000 by bootstrapping and Betterment, LLC was established as a Delaware corporation on April 7, 2009. It was launched at TechCrunch Disrupt New York, a contest for startups attended by 2000 entrepeneurs and investors, in June 2010.[^1] Within a day of the event, nearly 500 people signed up and funding companies started calling. Betterment received Series A funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December 2010. This round secured $3 million in funding.  By October 2012 it had received $10 million in Series B funding from Menlo Ventures, Bessemer and Anthemis Group.[^2] A recent study by S&P Global pegs the potential value of Betterment at $1.7 billion.[^8]


## Business Activities:


What is a robo-advisor? A robo-advisor collects information from clients regarding risk tolerance and goals and then provides advice, automated investing and prtfolio design. Robo-advisors provide access and money management options at a fraction of the cost of traditional portfolio managers. 

Betterment targets younger, more tech savvy investors who are looking for a hands off approach. With Betterment, you can invest your money passively, with automated contributions, and you can do it all from your phone. Depending on your investing goals you could be allocated in stocks, bonds or cash. Allocation defaults to a mix of stocks and bonds. For riskier appetites, they offer allocation to the Goldman Sachs Smart Beta portfolio, for investors who can tolerate lagging behind benchmarks but desire a higher long term return. They also offer bond only allocation for retirees or people with low risk tolerance. In addition to risk appetite, they also tackle tax consequences. They offer automated (and at no cost) tax loss harvesting, where losing positions are sold to provide tax losses. They even offer a tax coordinated portfolio which places non tax-efficient investments in accounts with the most favorable tax treatment and tax efficient investments in accounts with the least favorable tax treatment. [^4]

Betterment uses a variety of technology in its approach, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, Java, Ruby and Julia.[^6] According to their website, Betterment uses Julia to solve their own version of the"two-language problem". This occurs when the language most convenient to write a program in is not the same as the language that makes the most sense for running the program. Behind the scenes, the quantitative research team provides the projections and recommendations that make up the decision making engine. The engineers use this research and subsequent models to reach the customer. "We've invested significant resources in modernizing this research pipeline by converting our codebase from R to Julia and we're now able to ship updates to our quantitative models quicker, and with less risk of errors being introduced in translation." The Julia library serves around 18 million requests per day safely and efficiently.[^5]





## Landscape:

![robos map](https://www.investingsimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/best-roboadvisors-1.jpg)


The use of robo-advisors has grown tremendously since Betterment came on the scene. According to eMarketer, about 3.5 million investors used a robo-advisor in 2021, up 23.2% from 2020, which had record growth of 37.4%. This growth is expected to continue, with more than 5 million people using a robo-advisor by 2025.[^9] Adoption in wealthy millenials is particularly strong. Accordiung to a survey by Hearts and Wallets, 50% of millenials with $500,000 to invest use robo-advisors.[^10]

Since inception, many rivals have emerged for Betterment. One of their main rivals, Wealthfront, was just acquired by UBS for $1.4 billion. Other players in the space include Personal Capital Advisors, Blooom, Acorns and M1 Finance. [^11] Incumbent institutions have also started to get involved. Vanguard, Schwab, Fidelity, Merrell, Blackrock and now UBS all have robo-advising available. The AUM of all robo-advisors has grown to a projected $1.8 trillion in 2022. According to Statista, AUM are expected to be $2.8 trillion in 2025 with a total user count of 480 million.[^12]

According to Edward Gottfried, product manager for Betterment for Business, state-sponsored investment plans could continue to grow in 2022 and beyond. Not everyone has access to employer-based retirement plans and states are stepping up with state-based retirement plans that use automated investment services. This is particularly helpful for small businesses, which do not offer plans due to affordability or complexity.[^9] Another growth area is ESG investing, which stands for environmental, social, and governance investing. Kristen Carlisle, general manager of Betterment for Business, expects this growth to continue. The Department of Labor recently proposed adding ESG as an option for retirement plans.[^9]

## Results


The impact of Betterment has been undeniable. As one of the orginal robo-advisor, they are not quite king of the hill now, but by AUM, they are close. Betterment currently has an AUM of $30 billion with 615,000 individual clients.[^11]. Vanguard Robo-Advisors leads the list at $207 billion and 1.1 million clients, followed by Schwab Intelligent Portfolios with $66 billion AUM and 262,000 clients. Betterment is third followed by Wealthfront, with $21 billion AUM and 307,000 individual clients.[^11] 

CNBC and Forbes both named Betterment the best overall robo-advisor for 2022.[^14] [^15]. CNBC used factors such as minimum deposit and balance requirements, associated fees, welcome bonuses, customer support and educational resources. Betterment has $0 minimum and no trading fees along with an easy to use interface. There is a 0.25% annual account fee and premium accounts have a $100,000 minimum and a 0.4% annual fee. [^14] 

Performance is another metric that can be used to differentiate from competitors. Due to the nature of robo-advising, each person will get a different return. There is also not a lot of data available online. Backend Benchmarking ranked Betterment 7th with a return of 8.61%, though it was just south of Schwab's leading return of 9.48%. [^16]

## Recommendations


If I were to advise the company, I might suggest they create a higher risk offering, like commodity futures. Very recently, Betterment bought automated crypto portfolio provider Makara.[^13] This was my original idea before I found out about the acquisition. But I think commodity futures could be in high demand for clients with a higher risk tolerance, especially in this time of high inflation. I beleive Betterment already has the technology to add futures and would likely not incur much of a cost. Forbes noted Betterment's competitive annual advisory fee, ability to choose different portfolios for different goals and tax management features.[^15]
