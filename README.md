## Overview and Origin

![Betterment logo](/Homework-One/images/better2.png)


I chose Betterment, a robo-advisor. Betterment is an online investment company that offers investing and retirement solutions for its clients. Betterment was founded in 2008 by Jon Stein who started building the platform with his roomamte Sean Owen, a Google software engineer. Upon dealing with the regulatory landscape of building a broker-dealer, Stein brought in Eli Broverman as a co-founder. Broverman was a securities lawyer Stein had met over a regular poker game. They raised $320,000 by bootstrapping. Betterment, LLC was established as a Delaware corporation on April 7, 2009 and was launched at TechCrunch Disrupt New York, a contest for startups attended by 2000 entrepeneurs and investors, in June 2010. Within a day, nearly 500 people signed up and funding companies started calling. Betterment received Series A funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December 2010. This round secured $3 million in funding.  By October 2012 it had received $10 million in Series B funding from Menlo Ventures, Bessemer and Anthemis Group. 1 2
